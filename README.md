### Introduction to the Data
From "Data Analysis Project Information":

You have been engaged as a Data Science consultant by a coal terminal. They would
like you to investigate one of their heavy machines - RL1

You have been supplied one month worth of data for all of their machines. The
dataset shows what percentage of capacity for each machine was idle (unused) in any
given hour. You are required to deliver an R list with the following components:

* Character: Machine name
* Vector: (min, mean, max) utilisation for the month (excluding unknown hours)
* Logical: Has utilisation ever fallen below 90%? TRUE / FALSE
* Vector: All hours where utilisation is unknown (NAâ€™s)
* Dataframe: For this machine
* Plot: For all machines


### The Scripts
This project feautures a RMarkdown document produced in RStudio and knitted to HTML. Please view the .html, .Rmd, or .md file for an overview of both the assignment questions and my responses.
